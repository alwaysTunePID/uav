How to create an image of an SD-card

Insert the SD card. Find it with:
$ sudo fdisk -l

Unmount the device, for example:
$ sudo umount /dev/sdb

Now to create an image of the device:
$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=~/beaglebone.img bs=4M status=progress

To reinstall image do the same but switch places of the
directories in the dd command.

To mount your image-file on your computer:
$ fdisk -l /path/to/image
Do some multiplication with the result, in this case the product was 65536:
$ mount -o loop,offset=65536 Pi.img /mnt
